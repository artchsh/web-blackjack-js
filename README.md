# BlackJack VanilaJS
There was nothing to do, so I decided to make a Blackjack game. I do not know the rules very well, so I did by the rules as I know them. 
The code is not very clean, but at some point I'll clean it up and also fix a few bugs.


Installation and Editing
------
First you need to install tailwind.css
```npm install -D tailwindcss```

Then you need to watch for changes
```npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./styles/styles.css```

Also, if needed you need to edit `tailwind.config.js` as you need
